# Mountain Project Database Builder
This project is a web crawler built using [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) that aims to pull important metadata about both areas and routes
from [Mountain Project](https://mountainproject.com) into a MySQL database to serve as the backbone for a 3rd party API. The ultimate goal
with this project is to allow 3rd party developers to provide supplementary services for Mountain Project users.
